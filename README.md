# softdev-ticketingsystem
A Helpdesk Ticketing System developed for our final thesis project. While I primarily handled documentation, Iâ€™m uploading this project to showcase the work, as GitHub was not utilized during development.

Once the main programmer uploads their version of the project to their own GitHub account, I will use that as the primary repository and may fork it to make my own modifications or improvements.
